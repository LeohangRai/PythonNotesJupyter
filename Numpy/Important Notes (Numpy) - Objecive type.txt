If  you add int as well as char items in the array, the dtype will change into "<U11"

If you add int as well as float items in the array, all the items will be converted into float.

If you add variable number of items in two vectors like [[1,2,3],[1,2]]
it will be stored as an array of lists

#Example:
e = np.array([[1,2,3],[1,2]])

>array([list([1, 2, 3]), list([1, 2])], dtype=object)
ndim = 1


shape is not a method, it's an attribute.
so don't use paranthesis
