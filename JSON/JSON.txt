XML is not bad, it's just that it's very powerful, more powerful than we need in general.
JSON is very native to JavaScript


#Important Note:
In JSON, the names, i.e. they keys and values should be placed inside double quotes (" ") insted of  single quotes
It is alright to use single quotes in python dictionary but in JSON, double quotes is mandatory.
So make sure that the keys and values are placed inside double quotes before loading them with the
json.loads() function.

There are multiple ways to make sure to pass double quotes.
1. Using str.replace method:
data = data.replace(" ' ", ' " ')
---> Replaces single quote with double quote


2. json.dumps() method

Also, we can use the dump function to replace single quotes with double quotes and then send the string into the 
loads function as:


#Important Note
json.loads() is for loading a string
json.load() is for loading a json file
