Paranthesis are not treated as a keyword-esque character in regex.
But they can be used to specify where to start and stop string extraction.

For example:
let's say we want to extract the emails from the string:

"From: raileohang@herald.college.edu.np Sat Jan 5"

Here, we can see that the email is followed by a "From: "
Let's say that these patterns repeat in a txt file.

Then we can use:
^From (\S+@\S+)

This means, the string should start with From with a space, some non space chars followed by an "@" again 
followed by some non-space characters.


Example:
#Using paranthesis
x = 'From raileohang@herald.college.edu.np Sat Jan 5'
y = re.findall('^From (\S+@\S+)', x)
y

>['raileohang@herald.college.edu.np']
