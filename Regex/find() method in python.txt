Python String find() method

The find() method returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in given string. 
If its is not found then it returns -1.
#Syntax :
    str.find(sub,start,end)


NOTE : If start and end indexes are not provided then by default it takes 0 and length-1 as starting and 
ending indexes where ending indxes is not included in our search.
#Returns:
    returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in given string. If itâ€™s not found then it returns -1.


The find() method is similar to index(). The only difference is find() returns -1 if searched string is not found 
and index() throws an exception in this case.
