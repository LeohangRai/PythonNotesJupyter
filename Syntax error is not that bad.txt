syntax error doesn't mean that Python thinks you're bad.
It is not a judgement of your ability as a programmer,
it is not a judgement of your potential to be a programmer.
Syntax error means Python is lost.
You are learning Python's language because Python can't learn your language.
You're smarter than Python.
We can teach you.
You can learn, but Python can't.
And so when it says syntax error, even though you feel like it's a rejection,
syntax error simply means that Python is lost.
It just doesn't have really friendly words when it says it's lost,
it just goes syntax error, which literally is exactly what's happening.
Your syntax is not something that Python understands.
So just understand as you go through the next couple of weeks that you will be
frustrated.
